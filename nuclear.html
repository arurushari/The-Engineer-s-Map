  <h2>What Do Nuclear Engineers Do?</h2>
  <div class="photo" ><img src="images\nuc1.jpg"></div>
  <p>Nuclear engineers play a critical role in harnessing the power of atomic energy for peaceful and practical applications, including energy production, medical treatments, industrial applications, and national security. From designing nuclear reactors to improving radiation safety and advancing fusion energy research, nuclear engineers are at the forefront of innovation in one of the most powerful scientific fields.

  Applying principles of physics, thermodynamics, and materials science, nuclear engineers develop systems that safely control nuclear reactions, monitor radiation levels, and optimize reactor efficiency. They also work on fuel cycle technologies, nuclear waste management, and advanced medical imaging or cancer treatment systems like radiation therapy.

  In addition to detailed system design and technical calculations, nuclear engineers often use specialized simulation tools to model reactor behavior, radiation shielding, and emergency scenarios. These simulations help identify potential risks, optimize safety systems, and ensure compliance with rigorous international regulations.

  Nuclear engineers collaborate closely with professionals in mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering as well as health physicists and government regulators to develop and maintain safe, effective nuclear systems for civilian and industrial use.</p>
