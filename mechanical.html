    <p>Mechanical engineers play a vital role in designing, developing, and improving a wide range of machines and mechanical systems that impact our daily lives. From automobiles and aircraft to industrial robots, heating and cooling systems, and even amusement park rides, mechanical engineers are behind the innovation and functionality of these technologies.

Using principles of physics, mathematics, and material science, mechanical engineers analyze how things move, how much stress they can withstand, and how to optimize their performance for efficiency and safety. Their work can range from designing intricate components inside electronic devices to developing large-scale renewable energy systems like wind turbines.

In addition to creating detailed designs and technical drawings, mechanical engineers frequently utilize computer-aided design (CAD) software and simulation tools to model and test their ideas before physical prototypes are built. This process helps identify potential issues and allows engineers to refine their designs.

Mechanical engineers also troubleshoot and solve technical problems—whether that’s repairing malfunctioning machinery, improving energy efficiency in engines, or enhancing manufacturing processes. Collaboration with other engineering disciplines is often essential to develop complex products and systems.</p>

  <h2>Beginner Projects You Can Try</h2>
  <div class="project-carousel">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="images/mec1p.jpg" alt="Проект 1">
      <h3>Mini hydraulic arm</h3>
      <p>In this project, you'd build a small robotic arm that moves using syringes filled with water connected by rubber tubes. As you push or pull the syringes, the movement is transferred through the fluid, allowing different parts of the arm to move. This simulates how real-world machines like excavators or robotic arms operate, and it gives hands-on insight into how pressure and force work in hydraulic systems.</p>
