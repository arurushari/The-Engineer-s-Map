  <h2>What Do Biomedical Engineers Do?</h2>
    <div class="photo"><img src="images/bio1.jpg"></div>
    <p>Biomedical engineering is a field that combines biology, medicine, and engineering to improve human health. Biomedical engineers design and create medical devices like artificial limbs, heart monitors, and imaging machines (like MRI or X-rays). They also develop new technologies to help doctors diagnose and treat diseases more effectively. Some work with computers to create software for hospital equipment, while others research how the body responds to new materials used in surgery. This field is great for students who enjoy science, math, and helping people. It plays a big role in making healthcare safer, faster, and more effective for everyone, blending creativity with science to solve real-world medical problems.</p>
