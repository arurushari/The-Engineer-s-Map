            <p>Aerospace engineers design and build airplanes, rockets, satellites, and spacecraft. They study how these machines fly and work, using knowledge about air, engines, materials, and structures. They test parts for strength and efficiency, improve engines to make them faster and use less fuel, and create digital models to test on computers. They make sure all systems—like controls, communication, and navigation—work well together. These engineers create rockets, drones, and space rovers, helping advance technology in air and space travel.
